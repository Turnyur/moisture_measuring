# PC Based Soil Mositure Measuring System

The system has two parts
1. Hardware
2. Software

	# Hardware
The hardware part consist of Microcontroller, serial interface and some discrete electronic components.
The Microcontroller was programmed in Arduino programming environment and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/Turnyur/moisture_measuring/blob/master/arduino_code/pc_based_soil_moisture_measuring_system.ino)

	# Software

* The PC app is developed using JavaFX and Netbeans IDE.
source file are located [here](https://github.com/Turnyur/moisture_measuring/tree/master/system_code)
* Below are the screenshots of the application
